Task 1

The performance of the network printer server has become sluggish, causing interruptions in the workflow at the North Pole workshop. Santa has directed us to generate a support request and examine the network data to pinpoint the source of the issue. He suspects that the Grinch and his group may be involved in this situation. Could you verify if there is an IP Address that is sending an excessive amount of traffic to the printer server?

172.17.79.133 - filter for the printer ip = 192.168.68.128 and you'll see a lot of requests coming from that one

Task 2

Bytesparkle being the technical Lead, found traces of port scanning from the same IP identified in previous attack. Which port was then targeted for initial compromise of the printer?

9100 - look at the ports used after the portscan

Task 3

What is the full name of printer running on the server?

Northpole HP LaserJet 4200n - look through the requests after the initial compromise and reconstruct the name from one of the replies

Task 4

Grinch intercepted a list of nice and naughty children created by Santa. What was name of the second child on the nice list?

Douglas Price - look through the commands issued and see where the printer returns the nice kids list, commands are after the compromise

Task 5

The Grinch obtained a print job instruction file intended for a printer used by an employee named Elfin. It appears that Santa and the North Pole management team have made the decision to dismiss Elfin. Could you please provide the word for word rationale behind the decision to terminate Elfin's employment?

The addressed employee is confirmed to be working with grinch and team. According to Clause 69 , This calls for an immediate expulsion. - look through the commands issued and see where the printer wanted to print the layoff notice, commands are after the nice/naughty lists

Task 6

MerryChristmas+BonusAnnouncment - look through the commands issued and see where the printer mentions some scheduled jobs and get their name, commands are after elfin's layoff

Task 7

Amidst our ongoing analysis of the current packet capture, the situation has escalated alarmingly. Our security system has detected signs of post-exploitation activities on a highly critical server, which was supposed to be secure with SSH key-only access. This development has raised serious concerns within the security team. While Bytesparkle is investigating the breach, he speculated that this security incident might be connected to the earlier printer issue. Could you determine and provide the complete path of the file on the printer server that enabled the Grinch to laterally move to this critical server?

/Administration/securitykeys/ssh_systems/id_rsa - look throught the commands issued after the scheduled job and you'll see some security stuff pop up, and later the id_rsa for ssh appears

Task 8

What is size of this file in bytes?

1914 - obtained from the same pcl packet as the id_rsa before

Task 9

What was the hostname of the other compromised critical server?

christmas.gifts - obtained from the same pcl packet as the id_rsa from task7

Task 10

When did the Grinch attempt to delete a file from the printer? (UTC)

2023-12-08 12:18:14 - look through the commands issued (up until around the end) until you see a delete command via pcl issued for id_rsa, get its utc arrival time
